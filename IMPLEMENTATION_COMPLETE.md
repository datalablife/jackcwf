## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (Choose One Method)

#### Method A: Using GitHub CLI (Easiest)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
# macOS: brew install gh
# Windows: choco install gh
# Ubuntu/WSL: sudo apt-get install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Push code
cd /mnt/d/工作区/云开发/working
git push -u origin main
```

#### Method B: Using Git from Windows
If you have Git installed on Windows, you can avoid WSL network issues:
```powershell
# From PowerShell on Windows
cd "D:\工作区\云开发\working"
git push -u origin main
```

#### Method C: Using HTTPS with Token
```bash
# Create personal access token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Select: repo (full control of private repositories)

cd /mnt/d/工作区/云开发/working

# Option 1: One-time push with token
git push -u origin main

# Option 2: Store credentials
git config credential.helper store
git push -u origin main
# Enter token when prompted
```

#### Method D: Resolve WSL Network Issues
If you encounter "No such device or address":

```bash
# Test connectivity
ping github.com

# If ping fails, try DNS fix
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf'

# Test again
curl -I https://github.com

# Then retry push
git push -u origin main
```

**See `PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md` for detailed troubleshooting.**

### Step 2: Verify on GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash
# After successful push, verify:
# 1. Visit https://github.com/datalablife/jackcwf
# 2. Check that all files are visible
# 3. Verify .github/workflows/ is present
# 4. Check 'main' is the default branch
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Run automated setup
cd /mnt/d/工作区/云开发/working
./scripts/ci/setup-secrets.sh

# Follow interactive prompts to configure:
# - Coolify API token
# - GitHub Actions environments
# - Branch protection rules
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Actions (2 minutes)

1. Go to: `https://github.com/datalablife/jackcwf/settings/actions`
2. Select: **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
3. Save changes

### Step 5: Test the Pipeline (5-10 minutes)

Create a test pull request:
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b test/ci-verification

# Make a small change
echo "# Test CI/CD Pipeline" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD pipeline execution"
git push -u origin test/ci-verification

# Create PR via GitHub UI
# Watch Actions tab for workflow execution
# Should see CI workflow running
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Staging (Optional - 5 minutes)

After test PR is approved and merged:
```bash
# Go to Actions → CD workflow
# See "workflow_dispatch" option to manually trigger
# Select: environment = staging
# Click: "Run workflow"
```

### Step 7: Deploy to Production (Optional - 5 minutes)

When ready for production:
```bash
# Go to Actions → CD workflow
# Select: environment = production
# Click: "Run workflow"
# Approve deployment when prompted
```
