### Step 5: Test the Pipeline (10 minutes)
```bash
git checkout -b test/ci-verification
echo "# Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD"
git push -u origin test/ci-verification
# Create PR via GitHub UI
# Watch Actions tab for CI workflow
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Staging (5 minutes) [Optional]
- Actions → CD workflow → Run workflow
- Select environment: staging
